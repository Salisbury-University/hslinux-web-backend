## Key-values

If the library we are using for markdown doesn't support frontmatter parsing, that's fine. We'll just have to write it ourselves.

In the event we do have to write it ourselves, we should make the parser as flexible as possible, in the event we want to change the key name.

Note: I didn't try parsing these myself. so feel free to

## Date Parsing

Parse the date with Date.parse. It should give you a unixtime that is usable for creating a normal date string.

## Markdown / Content

This should entirely be handled by whatever library we use, marked, mdx, etc

## Future frontmatter keys

In the future we might look to add functionality by implementing new keys, such as

- categories
- toc
- description
- search_exclude ?
